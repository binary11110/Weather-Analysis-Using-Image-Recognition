Description:

Many industries have the need to identify current and past weather conditions. The data helps them plan, organize, and/or optimize their operations. Using CNNs offer the potential to automate this by providing a digital eye. If an image recognition model could be built to identify conditions by looking at images of the weather, it could be deployed to automatically trigger smart devices.

Dataset:
The full dataset can be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iKKAzNX92kSgznWQsmhPRL8dCyiymUE_?usp=sharing

This folder consists of two main subfolders:

Train : separated into 11 subfolders, the label of the images inside of a folder is the name of the folder itself

Test: 1300 images without labels

------------------------

Conclusion: 

The CNN Architecture scored the best accuracy, the 
AlexNet Architecture comes next, then the VGG16 
Architecture.
As we see, CNN Architecture is the best model among the 
rest of the models mentioned above.
